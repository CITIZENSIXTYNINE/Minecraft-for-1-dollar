# The Game(by)pass Exploit

### A theory for an exploit to get a FA (full access) copy/alt of Minecraft for 1€ for 3 Months

Before you follow any of the steps here, I have to clear some stuff:

- This has **NOT** been tested to any extent; it may or not work.
- I'm not responsible for any damages (say your credit/debit card getting blacklisted, Micheal coming to your house and beating you up, etc).
- This theory/method probably violates [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement) which can (and probably will) get you banned from using Microsoft services (Windows, Office, Outlook, Xbox, Azure, etc).
- This entire document (and its derivatives) are meant to be read, exanimated and/or reproduced with educational/demonstrational purposes.
- If you're a Microsoft employee (or an affiliate), feel free to email me at citizensixtynine@protonmail.com to discuss ways to patch this.

## Requirements

- A PC running Windows (Preferably a Virtual Machine)
- A Microsoft account that has not claimed the "Gamepass for 1$" promotion (Preferably one that you don't care about)
- A disposable/prepaid debit card 
- A phone number (optional; Microsoft may ask you for one)

## Preparation

To start it all, you'll need a fresh install of Windows (this is optional but you should do this), use something like VMWare Player or VirtualBox to install Windows. I recommend using Windows 10 Education as its the lightest version of Windows that has Microsoft Store support.

After installing Windows, create a brand new Microsoft account, just make sure to make the place of residence the same as the one in your card

Link your card to your Microsoft account and put a random street address (Note that Microsoft might ask you for a phone number for verification)

After all of this, you should be ready to do the actual "exploit".

## Exploit Time!

You'll now need to open your Start menu, Open the Microsoft Store, Click the "Gaming" section on the top section and search for something in the lines of "New subscribers get 3 months for 1€", click it and then click "Join" (remember to check that you're getting the 1€/1$/1£ offer price)

Go through all the steps that Microsoft may ask you and once you reach to the confirmation screen that you're now a Gamepass for PC subscriber.

Now, click the search icon and search for "Minecraft Launcher" and install it. Login with your brand new Microsoft account w/Gamepass, download the Java Edition and launch the game. 

After this, you should end up with a copy of the game that you can use to play. You can also link your new account to the launcher in your host machine through the launcher's account settings.

## Notes

As I said before, I hadn't tested this so I'm not sure about if this "exploit" actually works. If you ever decide to try it out, send me an email with your results at citizensixtynine@protonmail.com

Can somebody suggest a proper name for this? I like Game(by)pass but it sounds dumb and this isn't a bypass.
